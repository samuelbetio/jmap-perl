INSTALLATION:
=============

The included Makefile is targeted at Debian Jessie. This will most likely not
work on other platforms, so please adjust to your needs accordingly.

    make install

The installer will:

    - Install the prerequisite packages
    - Install a self-signed certificate for "jmap-proxy.local"
    - Install new Diffie-Hellman parameters for Nginx
    - Install an Nginx site config for "jmap-proxy.local"

If you want to use the Gmail OAUTH2, you will need your own secrets. Copy
config.example to config.json and replace XXX and YYY with your details.

RUNNING THE SERVER:
===================

The following scripts need to be run in parallel:

    - /home/jmap/jmap-perl/bin/apiendpoint.pl
    - /home/jmap/jmap-perl/bin/server.pl

ACCESSING THE PROXY:
====================

First, update your hosts file to include the proxy:

    echo <jmap-proxy-ip-address> jmap-proxy.local

Then point your browser to:

    https://jmap-proxy.local

Accept the self-signed certificate, then everything should be good to go!
